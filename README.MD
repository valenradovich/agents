# agents
here you can find some agents that i've coded for different tasks, all of them, almost from scratch.

## reddtriever
i'm always querying google or perplexity using 'site:reddit.com' to find relevant information about some topic, question, research, etc.
so i made this agent to just do that, in a easier and faster way. all from my terminal.

## reason-act
ReAct agent from scratch based on the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629).
it can search the web, get weather and play music in spotify.
the next will be:
- write and send emails.
- read and summarize emails.
- create events in google calendar.
- more stuff...
